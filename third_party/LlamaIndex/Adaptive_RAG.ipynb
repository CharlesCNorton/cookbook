    "# Adaptive RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "User queries in general can be complex queries, simple queries. One don't always need complex RAG system even to handle simple queries. [Adaptive RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403) proposes an approach to handle complex queries and simple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement an approach similar to Adaptive RAG, which differentiates between handling complex and simple queries. We'll focus on Lyft's 10k SEC filings for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will involve using `FunctionCalling` capabilities of `MistralAI` by defining a `FunctionCallingAgentWorker` to call different tools or indices based on the query's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex Queries:** These will leverage multiple tools that require context from several documents.\n",
    "- **Simple Queries:** These will utilize a single tool that requires context from a single document or directly use an LLM to provide an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the steps we follow here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download Data.\n",
    "2. Load Data.\n",
    "3. Create indices for 3 documents.\n",
    "4. Create query engines with documents and LLM.\n",
    "5. Create tools.\n",
    "6. Initialize a `FunctionCallingAgentWorker`.\n",
    "7. Querying."

This reduction was attributed to two main factors: (i) the use of the accelerated attribution method to recognize expenses for RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of the company's IPO Registration Statement, which resulted in higher stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the stock-based compensation benefit related to the restructuring in the second quarter of 2020.

       "<p style=\"font-size:20px\">assistant: In 2022, Lyft was committed to the continuous development and enhancement of its offerings. The company's ability to attract and retain drivers and riders heavily depends on its capacity to introduce new offerings and improve existing ones. Lyft invests in a patent program to protect its intellectual property rights in areas such as ridesharing, autonomous vehicle technology, micro-mobility, telecommunications, and networking. The company holds numerous issued and pending patents and continually reviews its development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of growth strategy, Lyft plans to increase rider use cases, grow its rider base, expand its share of consumers' transportation spend, deliver increasing value to drivers, and invest in its marketplace technology. The company is continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases, offering products to simplify travel decision-making and providing centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lyft also sees opportunities to grow its rider base by making incremental investments in its brand and growth marketing, providing a full range of price points and ride experiences, and expanding its network coverage. The company's transportation network spans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit, and vehicle services, aiming to deliver the best holistic experience to all of its riders and capture significantly more of its market opportunity.\n",
